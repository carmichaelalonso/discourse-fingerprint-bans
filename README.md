# discourse-fingerprint-bans
Plugin for Discourse for Staff users to ban specific browser fingerprints

## About
This plugin aims to capture a user's browser fingerprint and store it (to `PluginStore`). A user's complete history of browser fingerprints can be blocked to avoid a new session from being started with the same fingerprint.
